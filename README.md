# Web-Vis-Dashboard

In this assignment, we were tasked with building a website to display climate visualizations from a previous assignment. I built a home page, a visualization page for each of the four visualizations, a comparison page to view all the visualizations at the same time, and a data page to view the raw data in a table.

The website makes extensive use of Bootstrap and media queries, which allows for many features of the website, such as the navigation bar, image sizes, and layout, to be responsive to changes in screen size.

## Prerequisites

Climate data used in the visualizations was obtained using the citipy library and the Open Weather Map API. Visualizations were made in Matplotlib in Python.
